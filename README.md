This is a Discord bot to make conducting MUNs on discord a breeze.

Developed by former MUN delegates and chairs to fit the needs of virtual MUNs, this Bot contains all the commands needed to ensure a seamless experience.

<!-- [Check out the official docs here](https://www.python.org/). -->

The bot includes commands to start/stop polls, record voting stance, mute/unmute dels in VCs and gag them (using Discord's new server Timeout feature). It also provides a raise hand function to replace that of Zoom or MS Teams.

Delegates can also create and join blocs (txt and vc channels) by themselves.
